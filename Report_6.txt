My StoryMap presentation is able to place a narrative alongside the images, something that is lost when viewing on Flickr (link below) or another album based program. StoryMap is able to provide a narrative to my project that would otherwise be difficult to see through just the website. StoryMap is also able to give emphasis to the physical space that is being discussed and puts it in context of location. The slideshow feature provides the feeling like you are walking down the street, making the same observations that I did. The images are also accompanied by some metadata so the basic information is with the image, rather than being on Flickr and a spreadsheet (also attached below).
