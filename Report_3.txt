As mentioned in Dev. Report #1, the UNL campus has been more empty than ever since COVID-19 struck. The following photos document the emptiness of campus, the striking lack of students on a Friday between classes. You can see that the library is empty, only one of the tables outside of the library has students seated, the bus stop has no students waiting, and no one is seated on the Union steps enjoying food or each other’s company. Only a few students were seen walking the streets around campus, nothing like the normal stream funneling out of the Union or out of the dorms, as seen by the empty street in front of Abel Hall. Even the sorority houses were uncharacteristically empty and silent. A handful of students were seen on the soccer field, but they too, like many of the students in the photos were wearing masks. These 10 photos demonstrate the change in campus, the empty sidewalks that normally are packed. The silent hallways that are normally filled with voices. The barren library that is normally filled with the sounds of coffee and studying.
