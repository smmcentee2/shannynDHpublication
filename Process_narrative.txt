This Digital Humanities project started as a documentation of the impacts of COVID-19 on the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, specifically on the space of the city campus. The project first focused on my observations of campus and provided subsequent evidence for my claims including photos. These initial observations were also partnered with an analysis of certain DH tools such as WordPress (which I chose to house the overall project), Blogger, Omeka, and Flickr (which I used to house the photos and their metadata). The project then expanded to include the effects of COVID-19 on the entirety of downtown Lincoln. These additions followed a similar process as the first three reports. I added a new observation report focused on the Haymarket district of downtown and supplemented pictures in a separate report. I also provided an analysis of two more DH tools, one of which (StoryMap) is used to provide a linear narrative for the things I saw and photographed. The final additions to this project came in the form of acknowledging the different contexts that surround my work. My observations were all influenced by these contexts, even if they are not readily apparent. I added information about the history of the land that I made these observations and the people that once lived here. I also added information about the Black Lives Matter movement which is an ongoing influence on the country, Nebraska, and Lincoln. This movement and its history have had impacts on the social construction of the area and that influenced what I saw. Finally, I added notes about what the future of DH projects such as this one might look like. Through every series of edits, I restructured the design and navigation of the site, to keep the information accessible and the user experience clean.
